## Description

The motivation behind orderly was a real life scenario for me. I work in a company that builds enterprise grade software and we still use excel to manage some back log items.

## User Story

As a Service Delivery Manager I would like to have an application that will allow me to prioritise my backlog in an organised and easily accessible way, so I can present my backlog to the development team in a clear and concise format.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application prioritisation tool <br />
WHEN I load the application I am taken to the home page <br />
THEN I am asked to log in or sign up.<br />
WHEN I click on sign up<br />
THEN I am asked to enter my `username`,`email`, and `password` <br />
WHEN I signed up / logged in <br />
THEN I am presented with items in the prioritised backlog. <br />
WHEN I want to create an item in the backlog <br />
THEN I click add new and enter `zendesk #`, `title`,`description`,`JIRA story`,`date-created`, `Customer`, `Current status` and `comment`<br />
WHEN I want to change the priority of an item <br />
THEN I click on it and drag it to a new position <br />
WHEN I want to change some fields on an item <br />
THEN I click edit and enter the new field values <br />
WHEN I log out and in <br />
THEN I can see all the changes made to the prioritised backlog<br />
